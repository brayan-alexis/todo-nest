# To-Do Nest
Welcome to my repository of the task management web application developed with React.js! My application allows you to organize your to-do tasks easily and efficiently. Some of the key features of this application include:

 - **Task Management**: You can create, complete, or delete your own to-do tasks according to your needs.
 - **Data Persistence**: The application features data persistence, ensuring that your to-do tasks, including completed ones, are stored even if you close the browser and return later.
 - **Modern and Responsive Design**: I have designed the application with a modern and minimalist approach that adapts seamlessly to any screen size, whether it's on your desktop or mobile device.

## Demo
To-Do Nest 1.0: [https://brayan-alexis.github.io/todo-nest/](https://brayan-alexis.github.io/todo-nest/)

## Requirements

-   Node.js 16+
-   NPM

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project, giving you full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Status
The To-Do Nest application is currently in stable production in version 1.0. This means you can use it reliably to manage your to-do tasks.
